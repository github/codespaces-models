# Mistral Cookbook Examples

This folder contains examples adapted from the [Mistral Cookbook repository](https://github.com/mistralai/cookbook).

The samples were modified slightly to better run with the GitHub Models service.

## Examples

The following cookbook examples are available:

- [Evaluation](evaluation.ipynb): Provides a number of examples for evaluating the performance of a task performed by an LLM, concretely information extraction, code generation, summarization.
- [Function Calling](function_calling.ipynb): Simple example to demonstrate how function calling works with Mistral models.
- [Prefix: Use Cases](prefix_use_cases.ipynb): Add a prefix to the model's response via the API.
- [Prompting Capabilities](prompting_capabilities.ipynb): Example prompts showing classification, summarization, personalization, and evaluation.
