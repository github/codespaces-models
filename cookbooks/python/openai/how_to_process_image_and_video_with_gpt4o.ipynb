    "\n",
    "The token cost of an input image depends on two main factors: the size of the image and the detail setting (low or high) used for each image. Here's a breakdown of how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Detail: Low resolution mode**\n",
    "    - Low detail allows the API to return faster responses and consume fewer input tokens for use cases that don’t require high detail.\n",
    "    - These images cost 85 tokens each, regardless of the image size.\n",
    "    - **Example: 4096 x 8192 image (low detail)**: The cost is a fixed 85 tokens, because it's a low detail image, and the size doesn't affect the cost in this mode.\n",
    "      \n",
    "- **Detail: High resolution mode**\n",
    "    - High detail lets the API see the image in more detail by cropping it into smaller squares. Each square uses more tokens to generate text.\n",
    "    - The token cost is calculated by a series of scaling steps:\n",
    "        1. The image is first scaled to fit within a 2048 x 2048 square while maintaining its aspect ratio.\n",
    "        1. The image is then scaled down so that the shortest side is 768 pixels long.\n",
    "        1. The image is divided into 512-pixel square tiles, and the number of these tiles (rounding up for partial tiles) determines the final cost. Each tile costs 170 tokens.\n",
    "        1. An additional 85 tokens are added to the total cost.\n",
    "    - **Example: 2048 x 4096 image (high detail)**\n",
    "        1. Initially resized to 1024 x 2048 to fit in the 2048 square.\n",
    "        1. Further resized to 768 x 1536.\n",
    "        1. Requires six 512px tiles to cover.\n",
    "        1. Total cost is `170 × 6 + 85 = 1105` tokens.\n"
